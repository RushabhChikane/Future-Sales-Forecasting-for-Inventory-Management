# Future-Sales-Forecasting-for-Inventory-Management
This project focuses on forecasting future sales to optimize inventory management and sales strategies by
analyzing historical data. Advanced time series forecasting techniques were applied to identify patterns
and predict future demand accurately. For presenting the results, data visualization tools were employed
to provide clear insights into sales forecasts and potential inventory challenges. These insights support
informed decision- making, helping to minimize stockouts, reduce excess inventory, and align sales strategies
with anticipated demand.
